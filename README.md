# Timer

This is a simple timer project that can be used to teach the basics of electornics and programming to students in middle and high school. 

## Hardware

This project uses:

* An Arduino unit (tested with UNO and Nano units).
* A 4-7-Segment display (Suggested part number: 5461AS)
* A basic piezo-buzzer/speaker
* A push button tactile switch.
* Wires, resistors, and LEDs

See the `hardware/` directory for schematics and pictures. 

## Software

This project uses code in a single Arduino .ino file, `timer.ino`. The code was made as simple as possible to faciliate learning by younger students.
